## Warning
Use it at your own risk!
<br>In theory the llm can not do any real harm since it just is not able to use real commands or write code.
<br>But our future oppressors may prove me wrong, so please be careful.

## Download
For now, I do not feel like it is a thing and at this point it should not be used on public servers! 
However, as soon as enough testing has been done there will be (probably) a release.

## Installation
1. Set up development environment:
   <br>https://wiki.fabricmc.net/tutorial:setup
2. Clone the repository and open the main directory as project.
3. Edit the config file and put in the model name!
      <br>For example: "gemma3:latest"
4. You can Run the project in ide. 
5. Or build the project with Gradle.
6. Make sure Ollama ist installed on your system!
